# white-eyes
WhiteEyes is a short script for reading HSReplay screenshots using OpenCV-Python. It returns the minion stats on both sides, number of cards, mana, health and armour values.
As an alternative to parsing lengthy xml files, it can be used as a tool for data crunching large quantities of HSReplay files (such as if one wants to embark on some ML).
Included in the repo is a test screenshot to check that the algorithm is working fine, with the test command already included in the script.
The repo is open source since there's still a few tweaks to be made, namely differentiating a '1' from a '4' in some cases. Hope this is useful.
